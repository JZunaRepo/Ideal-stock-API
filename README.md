# IDEAL STOCK API 

Ideal stock API allows 

Application programming interfaces are a great way to collect valuable information from a server to your computer. In this project we used the website: https://polygon.io/ to request information of stocks from 2021-03-29 to 2022-05-25 and then apply statistical analysis on the weekly closing price of the desire stock.

In the script use for thisp project, we solely rely on the built-in fucntions and modules available on python. Additionally, you will find csv files where the information of the API was collected, saved, and then used for statistical analysis. 

Please refer to the following section for more information of this project.
